# Weather_App
It is my hands-on project. In that project create a Weather App for a Website using HTML CSS and JavaScript. We will get the current weather data from Fess API fey from Open Weather Map and display the weather information like Temperature,  Weather conditions, Humidity, and Wind Speed according to the city on our website or app.
